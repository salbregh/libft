# LIBFT

##### My first 42 network project, reimplementing my own C standard function library. The aim of this project is understanding how the standard functions in C work. The aim of rewriting the functions is to get a full understanding of how they work and how/when to use them.


***

### Usage

### How to compile the libft library
* Clone this git repository
`git clone https://github.com/salbregh/libft.git`

* Go into the root of the directory <br>
`cd libft`

* Run the make command, which will create the libft.a library<br>
`make`


### RULES
* Code is writtin according to the 42 network norm
* All code must compile with flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra
* No memory leaks allowed
* Forbidden to use global variables
* Use of the following functions is allowed:
    * malloc
    * free
    * write
* Must include a Makefile

***
### Funtions
The functions needed to be implemented following original ones:
* isalpha
* isdigit
* isalnum
* isascii
* isprint
* strlen
* memset
* bzero
* memcpy
* memmove
* strlcpy
* strlcat
* toupper
* tolower
* strchr
* strrchr
* strncmp
* memchr
* memcmp
* strnstr
* atoi
* calloc
* strdup

Additional function to implement:
* ft_substr
* ft_strjoin
* ft_strtrim
* ft_split
* ft_itoa
* ft_strmapi
* ft_putchar_fd
* ft_putstr_fd
* ft_putendl_fd
* ft_putnbr_fd
