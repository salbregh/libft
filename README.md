# LIBFT
#### My first 42 network project at Codam. This project codes a C library regrouping usual function that are allowed to be used in future school projects. The aim of rewriting the functions is to get a full understanding of how they work and how to use them.

* Code is writting according to the Norm
* All code must compile with flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra
* No memory leaks allowed
* Forbidden to use global variables
* Use of the following functions is allowed:
    * malloc
    * free
    * write
